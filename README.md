# React Developer Tools Extension

This is a powerful browser extension designed to enhance the development and debugging experience for React applications. It provides a suite of tools and features to inspect, monitor, and manipulate React components, state, and performance.

## Features

- Inspect and visualize React component hierarchies
- Monitor and modify component props and state
- Analyze performance metrics and identify bottlenecks
- Integrate with Redux DevTools for state management debugging
- Capture and replay user interactions for bug reproduction
- Inject custom scripts and styles for runtime manipulation
- Extensible architecture for adding custom plugins and features

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-devtools-extension.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-devtools-extension`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the extension: `npm run build`
5. Load the extension in your browser:
   - Chrome: Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable "Developer mode", click "Load unpacked", and select the `dist` directory from the project.
   - Firefox: Go to `about:debugging`, click "Load Temporary Add-on", and select the `manifest.json` file from the `dist` directory.

## Development

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast and efficient development. To start a development server with hot-reloading:
